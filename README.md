## About your contributions to RealmJoin content
### Minor corrections

### Larger submissions
If you submit a pull request with new or significant changes to documentation and code examples, we'll send a comment in GitHub asking you to submit an online Contribution License Agreement (CLA) if you are not an employee of Gl√ºck & Kanja.

## Repository organization
The content in the docs repository follows the organization of documentation on https://realmjoin.readthedocs.org. This repository contains two root folders:

### \docs
The \*docs* folder contains the documentation articles formatted as markdown files with an *.md* extension.

The \*docs* folder contains the \*media* folder for root directory article media files, inside which are subfolders with the images for each article.  The service folders contain a separate media folder for the articles within each service folder. The article image folders are named identically to the article file, minus the *.md* file extension.

### \contributor-guide
This folder contains articles that are part of our contributors' guide.

## Use GitHub, Git, and this repository
For information about how to contribute, how to use the GitHub UI to contribute small changes, and how to fork and clone the repository for more significant contributions, see [Install and set up tools for authoring in GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/azure-docs/blob/master/contributor-guide/tools-and-setup.md).

If you install GitBash and choose to work locally, the steps for creating a new local working branch, making changes, and submitting the changes back to the main branch are listed in [Git commands for creating a new article or updating an existing article](https://github.com/Microsoft/azure-docs/blob/master/contributor-guide/git-commands-for-master.md)

### Branches
We recommend that you create local working branches that target a specific scope of change. Each branch should be limited to a single concept/article both to streamline work flow and reduce the possibility of merge conflicts.  The following efforts are of the appropriate scope for a new branch:

* A new article (and associated images)
* Spelling and grammar edits on an article.
* Applying a single formatting change across a large set of articles (e.g. new copyright footer).

## How to use markdown to format your topic
All the articles in this repository use GitHub flavored markdown.  Here's a list of resources.

* [Markdown basics](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/)
* [Printable markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/Microsoft/azure-docs/blob/master/contributor-guide/media/documents/markdown-cheatsheet.pdf?raw=true)
